The following script is a bivariate vector autoregressive model. Vector Autoregression (VAR) is one of the most common econometric models in forecasting macroeconomic variables.
It shows how variables of interest interact not only with their own lagged series, but also the series of the other macroeconomic variables. It is usually used by the Central Banks or 
other monetary institutions. One of the most useful applications of VAR models are Impulse Response Functions (IRF). IRFs show how a shock in one variable is likely to affect another
variable. For example, if the economy undergoes positive inflation shock, how it is likely to affect consumption.
